# Information for params
# DATA_PATH: The name of the folder of dataset
# DATASET: The name of the dataset
# AUG_TRAIN: Which policy to use for train. Check src/augmentation/policies.py
# AUG_TEST: Which policy to use for test. Check src/augmentation/policies.py
# AUG_TRAIN_PARAMS: null if AUG_TRAIN does not contain "randaugment" else need (n_select, level, n_level)
#   n_select: The number of random augmentations you want to apply
#   level: The magnitude of augmentation (how strong), if you set level to null, it will choose randomly
#   n_level: level will be choosen between 0, n_level, and the magnitude will be (level / n_level)
# AUG_TEST_PARAMS: Always set to null
# BATCH_SIZE: Batch size for training
# VAL_RATIO:  How many data to be used for validation checking
